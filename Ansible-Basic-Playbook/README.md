# Ansible Basic Playbook

* The inventory file `/home/thor/ansible/inventory` seems to be having some issues, please fix them. The playbook needs to be run on App Server 3 in Stratos DC, so inventory file needs to be updated accordingly.

* Create a playbook `/home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml` and add a task to create an empty file `/tmp/file.txt` on App Server 3.
